<p>Modular multilevel converters (MMCs) are widely used in the design of modern high-voltage direct current (HVdc) transmission system. High-fidelity dynamic models of MMCs-based HVdc system require small simulation time step and can be accurately modeled in electro-magnetic transient (EMT) simulation programs. The EMT program exhibits slow simulation speed and limitation on the size of the model and brings certain challenges to test the high-fidelity HVdc model in system-level simulations. This paper presents the design and implementation of a hybrid simulation framework, which enables the co-simulation of the EMT model of Atlanta-Orlando HVdc line and the transient stability (TS) model of the entire Eastern Interconnection system. This paper also introduces the implementation of two high-fidelity HVdc line models simulated at different time steps and discusses a dedicated method for sizing the buffer areas on both sides of the HVdc line. The simulation results of the two HVdc models with different sizes of buffer areas are presented and compared.</p>
