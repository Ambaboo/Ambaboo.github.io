			<p class="lead">Currently I am working at NVIDIA in California. I completed my Ph.D. at Georgia
				Tech, where I investigated novel methodologies of modelling, protection, and high-performance numerical
				simulation of large-scale cyber-physical systems. While at school, I spent my summers in Amazon Web
				Services, Oak Ridge National Laboratory and Facebook, working on machine learning modelling,
				GPU-accelerated simulation, and search/information retrieval, respectively.</p>
