			<h3 id="biography">Biography</h3>
			<p class="lead">I am a fifth-year Ph.D. student at School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Georgia Institute of Technology, advised by Prof. Maryam Saeedifard. We are investigating novel methodologies of modelling, protection, and high-performance simulation for large-scale cyber-physical systems.</p>
			<p class="lead">Before moving to Georgia Tech, I obtained my B.E. degree with Honors in Electrical and Computer Engineering from Zhejiang University in 2015. I spent my summers in Amazon Web Services, Oak Ridge National Laboratory and Facebook, working on machine learning modelling, GPU-accelerated simulation, and search/information retrieval, respectively.</p>

				<h3 id="research_interests">Research Interests</h3>
				<p class="lead">I am broadly interested in power system, high-performance computing and artificial intelligence. Within power system, my subdisciplinary interests lie in simualtion, protection, and optimization for large-scale cyber-physical infrastructure systems, such as multi-terminal high-voltage direct-current (HVDC) grids, with emphasis on their robustness, reliability and security.</p> -->
