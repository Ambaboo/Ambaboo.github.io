								Protection against DC faults is one of the main technical challenges for the operation of converter-based HVDC systems. Protection becomes even more challenging when the HVDC systems are expanded to multi-terminal DC (MTDC) grids with more than two terminals/converter stations. Similar to their AC counterparts, proper protection of the MTDC grids necessitates both primary and backup protection schemes in which, in case of malfunctioning/failure of primary protection, backup protection trips as fast as possible. Although several backup relaying algorithms such as current threshold- and classifier-based methods have been proposed, none of them offers sufficient speed, robustness, and scalability. In this paper, a novel backup protection algorithm based on quickest change detection (QCD) technique is proposed, which offers fast and robust backup protection functionality for the primary relay. Performance and effectiveness of the proposed algorithm are evaluated and verified with time-domain simulation studies in the PSCAD/EMTDC environment. The study results confirm satisfactory performance of the proposed algorithm in terms of accuracy, robustness, and speed under various fault scenarios. The proposed method is applicable to different grid configurations and is able to cooperate with different primary protection algorithms and breaker configurations.

							Sea ice thickness evolution within the Canadian Arctic Archipelago (CAA) is of great interest to science, as well as local communities and their economy. In this study, based on the NEMO numerical framework including the LIM2 sea ice module, simulations at both 1∕4 and 1∕12° horizontal resolution were conducted from 2002 to 2016. The model captures well the general spatial distribution of ice thickness in the CAA region, with very thick sea ice (∼ 4m and thicker) in the northern CAA, thick sea ice (2.5 to 3m) in the west-central Parry Channel and M'Clintock Channel, and thin ( < 2m) ice (in winter months) on the east side of CAA (e.g., eastern Parry Channel, Baffin Island coast) and in the channels in southern areas. Even though the configurations still have resolution limitations in resolving the exact observation sites, simulated ice thickness compares reasonably (seasonal cycle and amplitudes) with weekly Environment and Climate Change Canada (ECCC) New Ice Thickness Program data at first-year landfast ice sites except at the northern sites with high concentration of old ice. At 1∕4 to 1∕12° scale, model resolution does not play a significant role in the sea ice simulation except to improve local dynamics because of better coastline representation. Sea ice growth is decomposed into thermodynamic and dynamic (including all non-thermodynamic processes in the model) contributions to study the ice thickness evolution. Relatively smaller thermodynamic contribution to ice growth between December and the following April is found in the thick and very thick ice regions, with larger contributions in the thin ice-covered region. No significant trend in winter maximum ice volume is found in the northern CAA and Baffin Bay while a decline ($r^2$ ≈ 0.6, $p$ < 0.01) is simulated in Parry Channel region. The two main contributors (thermodynamic growth and lateral transport) have high interannual variabilities which largely balance each other, so that maximum ice volume can vary interannually by ±12% in the northern CAA, ±15% in Parry Channel, and ±9% in Baffin Bay. Further quantitative evaluation is required.</span>

						A sequential switching strategy for hybrid DC circuit breaker (CB) is proposed to improve transients during DC fault interruption in Multi-terminal HVDC (MTDC) grids. Compared to the conventionally tripped DC CB, the proposed switching strategy, which sequentially trips the breaking modules within the CB, reduces the peak fault current and overvoltage as well as fault clearance time. These metrics are analytically computed through a time-domain calculation approach considering the traveling wave phenomena in DC transmission systems. By rescheduling the tripping sequence and optimal rating and number of individual modules of the CB, the energy distributed among the modules is well balanced. Finally, an analytic evaluation of the proposed sequential tripping is performed and, subsequently, the best practice and the optimal design process are provided. Performance of the sequential switching strategy as well as the optimal design process are verified through simulation studies in the PSCAD/EMTDC software environment.

					This paper proposes a time-domain method to calculate the fault response in Multi-Terminal DC (MTDC) grids and the performance of hybrid DC breaker. The proposed method, based on travelling waves, (i) provides a sound representation of fault performance by considering all created travelling waves, (ii) introduces a new approach to estimate the reflection coefficients, and (iii) provides an approximation of the worst-case fault location. Then, based on the analytical results, three parameters of the hybrid DC circuit breaker, i.e., current limiting reactor, arrester rated voltage, and time delay are optimally selected with respect to maximum overcurrent, maximum overvoltage, fault clearance time, and energy absorption in arresters through multi-objective optimization. Accuracy and performance of the proposed method are evaluated and verified by time-domain simulation studies in the PSCAD/EMTDC environment using frequency-dependent models. The results confirm reasonable accuracy of the proposed fault performance calculation and represent a further step towards optimized design of hybrid DC circuit breakers.

													There is increasing interest in alternate arm converter (AAC) due to the fault-tolerant characteristics it could offer in high-voltage direct current (HVdc) systems. The simulation of AACs is important to assist with the design of hardware, control systems, and planning of power system expansions. However, simulation of AAC-HVdc using existing software takes a long time due to the presence of a large number of states and non-linear devices. An ultra-fast single- or multi-CPU simulation algorithm to simulate the AAC-HVdc system based on state-space models and using hybrid discretization algorithm with a relaxation technique that reduces the imposed computational burden is presented in this paper. The developed algorithm is validated with respect to reference PSCAD/EMTDC model.

												The hybrid solid-state DC circuit breakers (DC CBs) have become one of the most promising technologies to address the protection challenges within multi-terminal DC (MTDC) grids. Those breakers are designed in such a way that a large number of identical modules are connected in series to enable extinguishing the fault current with the arresters embedded in them. Conventionally, these modules are commanded to trip simultaneously, creating significant overvoltage and overcurrent stresses for the rest of the system. To attenuate these adverse impacts, in this paper, a sequential tripping method is proposed to improve the performance of hybrid DC CBs through commanding the main breakers to trip in a sequential manner. It has been verified that by the proposed method, fault clearance is expedited while the maximum overcurrent is reduced. To address the unbalanced energy absorptions among the different modules of the CB, a modified sequential tripping scheme is also proposed. By rescheduling the sequential tripping sequence, this method enables an equal redistribution of energy, which greatly reduces the risk of thermal overloading. Both of the proposed methods are evaluated and tested under a practical six-terminal DC grid in the PSCAD/EMTDC software environment. The performance and effectiveness of the proposed methods are confirmed by simulation results.

											Fast control afforded by power electronics in high-voltage direct current (HVdc) systems, especially voltage-source converter (VSC) based HVdc systems, needs to be carefully assessed to identify stability boundaries. While there are several averaged models of VSC-HVdc systems that have been studied with low bandwidth alternating current (ac) system models, there have been limited studies to show the need for high-fidelity models to understand the control interactions between different VSC-HVdc systems as well as with other grid components. In this paper, the fidelity of power electronics and connected grid components like transmission lines are identified based on defined use-cases to understand the stability and impact of the fast control afforded by VSC-HVdc systems. These results will be useful to understand the methods required to study control in VSC-HVdc systems.

Currently the poorest country in the Western Hemisphere, Haiti suffers from a lack of energy infrastructure leaving over 7.4 million people without power. The electrification rates are the worst in the rural, mountainous regions of Haiti where in 2013 only 15% of residents had access to electricity. The Georgia Institute of Technology’s Haiti RELAY team was created in 2015 to help spark the growth of electrification rates in these regions through the development of a simple, cost-effective, and portable solar home system called the “Haiti RELAY”. This fully-integrated solar charge controller device was designed through a data-driven approach to provide a consistent means for house lighting and phone charging. In May 2018, the Haiti RELAY team travelled to enact the Haiti RELAY pilot program in the mountains of Thoman, Haiti. As a part of this program, 25 families acquired a RELAY and agreed to provide feedback to help the team understand the efficacy of the design and the necessary improvements for moving the product towards full-scale production. This paper details the energy situation in Haiti, construction and functionality of the Haiti RELAY, and the results of the 2018 mission to Thoman.

								Converters are a vital part of modern-day power systems. Converter losses are essential in determining the efficiency of power delivery. This paper presents a physically based modeling of converters for accurate evaluation of converter losses. It is a novel approach that can compute total losses for any type of converters with high fidelity as well as the distribution of losses among the various components of the converter. A standard modeling syntax is described in detail. Two example converters are constructed and their performance and losses are evaluated to demonstrate the usefulness of this modeling technique. Simulation results show that the method provides the total converter losses as well as the losses of each part of the converter components, making it an excellent tool for identifying the parts of a converter where most of losses occur. This information can be used for design optimization.

						The challenges of energy efficiency and comfort management of intelligent homes and buildings are usually tackled with methods relying on historical data and a large number sensors. In this paper, we propose a real-time human activity-based energy management system (HAEMS), which tracks and processes human movement, and achieves device control based on real-time data with a significantly reduced number of sensors. A human activity detection algorithm and a model predictive control scheme are developed and implemented to optimally manage energy. A multi-objective optimization problem is formulated to minimize electricity cost and control temperature for thermal comfort. The HAEMS is deployed in a scaled-down laboratory setup and the performance is evaluated in an embedded system and hardware environment. Experimental results show that this system is able to optimize both electricity cost and thermal comfort.

				Evolution of today’s predominantly alternating current (ac) transmission grid in to mixed ac transmission – high-voltage direct current (HVdc) systems is expected with the decreasing costs of and advancements in power electronics technologies. The recent technological advancements include the development of more efficient and compact voltage source converters (VSCs) that can provide fast response. Because of their controllability and fast response, HVdc systems provide the ability to enhance reliability of the ac transmission grid through frequency support, voltage control, and congestion relief. The HVdc systems can also provide other ancillary services to enhance the economics and reliability of the ac transmission grids, and to optimize their performance. The tools, models, and methods developed to evaluate their benefits will be key enablers to understanding the value proposition introduced by the fast-acting HVdc systems.
				The main motivation of this work was to develop models and methods to explore and quantify the technical and economic benefits of HVdc systems and fast response VSC technologies in the future grid of United States. The models and methods explore the benefits of HVdc systems through provision of controlled active/reactive power and fast response. The fast response can provide much-needed multiobjective services to the grid (e.g., frequency response, voltage control) while moving blocks of energy.
				The models and methods can be applied to study other power electronics technologies and scenarios such as those undertaken in ongoing studies led by the North American Electric Reliability Corporation (NERC) Inverter-based Resource Performance Task Force (IRPTF). The IRPTF studies identify the problems associated with power electronics-based technologies as they are integrated in to the bulk power system (or the ac transmission system).
