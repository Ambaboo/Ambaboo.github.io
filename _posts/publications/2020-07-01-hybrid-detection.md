#### Abstract

Protection against dc faults is one of the main technical hurdles faced when operating converter-based HVdc systems. Protection becomes even more challenging for multi-terminal dc (MTdc) systems with more than two terminals/converter stations. In this paper, a hybrid primary fault detection algorithm for MTdc systems is proposed to detect a broad range of failures. Sensor measurements, i.e., line currents and dc reactor voltages measured at local terminals, are first processed by a top-level context clustering algorithm. For each cluster, the best fault detector is selected among a detector pool according to a rule resulting from a learning algorithm. The detector pool consists of several existing detection algorithms, each performing differently across fault scenarios. The proposed hybrid primary detection algorithm: i) detects all major fault types including pole-to-pole (P2P), pole-to-ground (P2G), and external dc fault; ii) provides a wide detection region covering faults with various fault locations and impedances; iii) is more robust to noisy sensor measurements compared to the existing methods. Performance and effectiveness of the proposed algorithm are evaluated and verified based on time-domain simulations in the PSCAD/EMTDC software environment. The results confirm satisfactory operation, accuracy, and detection speed of the proposed algorithm under various fault scenarios.
