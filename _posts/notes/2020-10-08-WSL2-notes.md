### Settings

#### `/etc/resolv.conf` is overwritten at launch [1]

When using `ssh`, the hostname could be resolved from `/etc/resolv.conf`, but WSL2 will overwrite this file everytime it restarts. To disable this feature, we first add the following to `/etc/wsl.conf`

```bash
[network]
generateResolvConf = false
```

Then exit Windows Terminal and restart WSL2 by `wsl --shutdown` in PowerShell. Open Windows Terminal again and write the desired content to `/etc/resolv.conf`. This file will not be overwritten anymore.
