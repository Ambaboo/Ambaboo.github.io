### Argo sleeps in a Circle!

Argo (our kitten) is one-year-old this month. She loves curling up into a circle whiling taking a short nap. Like these :)

### A small piece of Art for her

I really enjoying watching her sleeping in a circle. As her birthday gift, I drawed an icon in Illustrator.

#### Step 1

Use the `Ellipse Tool` to draw an ellipse and fill it.

#### Step 2

Draw the two ears with curves using the `Curvature Tool`.

#### Step 3

Finally, outline her tail using an opposite color with the `Curvature Tool`.
