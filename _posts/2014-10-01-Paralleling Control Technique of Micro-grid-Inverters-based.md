Creating a blog with Jekyll and github is just too awesome. The power of git and the simplicity of markdown makes for a brilliant combo.

I'd generated some static websites with [Proton](http://ricostacruz.com/proton/) before, but Jekyll is way cool for blogging. Only three our four template files files are needed. Just add some markdown formatted posts, and bam, you're done!

Since it's database-less, it naturally plays well with git. But the bacon is that github supports it out of the box! Just create a rep called username.github.com, push your Jekyll files, and there you have it! Automated deployment with version control for the people (well at least for developers).
